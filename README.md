# Fuel-Consumption-Analys-and-Linear-Regression
n this project, we analyze a dataset of fuel consumption and various automobile design and performance metrics from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine. We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), clean the data, and build a linear regression model to predict fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, mpg).
